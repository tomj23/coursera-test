1. It has to become second nature, for a programmer, to notice when a concept is begging to be abstracted into a new word.
2. Higher-order functions allow us to abstract over actions, not just values.

Methods are simply properties that hold function values.

1. You are going to need to know the conventions for programming in the programming language you are learning, 
but you should take special care to try and figure out what is part of the actual language 
and what is part of the libraries that are often used with the language.

2. What you’ll realize is that, for most programming languages, the actual language part itself is not that large 
and is relatively easy to learn, but the standard libraries are large and knowing your way around them is going to be 
the more difficult endeavor.

Programming today is more about knowing how to use libraries and frameworks than being an absolute expert in the language.
That is one of the reasons why this distinction is important.

By realizing what is not part of the language but is rather part of the library and learning how to look up libraries 
for common tasks you want to accomplish in the language, you’ll become a much better programmer.

a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.
 1 Read the problem completely twice.
 2 Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
 3 Optimize the manual steps.
 4 Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
 5 Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
 6 Optimize the real code.

As much as 70% of our time should be spent in steps 1-3. 
the biggest secret in programming:“Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!”

Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps 
and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.
